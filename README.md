## Scattering_maxp

### Introduction
> This is for the scattering-maxp network, which is the modified version of scattering network by S.Mallat. In paper [1], a way of combining scattering network with max-pooling network is introduced. This repository is for support of experiments in [1]. The experiments are image classifications tasks. Where the training data is Caltech-101 [2] and Caltech-256 [3]. 


### Set-up 
> TensorFlow 1.15.1 & Keras 2.2.7-tf.
